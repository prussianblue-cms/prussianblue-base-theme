# PrussianBlue Starterkit

This module provides a starting point for theming a PrussianBlue website.

It contains (or rather, will contain):

- Templates for page, layouts and all the components (paragraphs, menus, blocks, everything).
- Styles for typography, as well as font files.
- Styles for all the components.
- Developer documentation.


## Developer experience guides

While developing the base and starterkit themes for PrussianBlue my intention is to make the developer experience as enjoyable and effective as possible.

To achieve this, I will focus on:

- Keeping cognitive load low
- Maximizing clarity and readability
- Documenting complex relationships if they are unavoidable
- Documenting rules devs can follow to keep things predictable

All without sacrificing flexibility. So, wish me luck!
