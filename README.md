# PrussianBlue Base Theme

The base theme exists just to reduce the complexity of the files in the starterkit. It provides the Drupal styles from starterkit, the regions configuration and the prussianblue-level developer documentation.

Do not use this theme directly. It's meant to be the base for starterkit.

To theme a PrussianBlue site, you want to be cloning the prussianblue_starterkit theme, which is found in `/themes/`. Go there to find useful documentation on theming a site.
